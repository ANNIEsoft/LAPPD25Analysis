# FIGURES

This folder contains pdfs and rootscripts the Figures used in the paper. This readme documents the pedigree (data used, analysis parameters, etc) of each of the figures.

Tables detailing the data collected can be found here:

The "original figures" folder contains the canonical gain,amplitude, and timing plots. These were taken on March 29th at 2500-2150-1350 V. The FILT_blsub folder contains the PHD and amplitude plots. NoFILT_blsub contains the TTS.

The "parallel scan" folder contains plots related to the parallel scan data taken on 7.31.18. The underlying table for the differential time vs. parallel position plot is on the googledoc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DZUc3RvsuZPxfdr7uzN7CPcl-zOcKjsS1-dTGzqaQfM/edit#gid=1008677585 under the difftime tab.

The "position scan" folder contains data taken at all of the positions, with folders providing the amplitude plot and TTS plot. The figures "Single PE Amplitude Peak" and "Single PE Time Resolution" are derived from the google doc. The points for 2R, 4C, and 17 C are excluded because they look like something went wrong. These may be sitting on the x-spacer. positions.png (and the keynote file) plot the locations where the tests were made.
